## Intro
If you've not read my [first few posts][Introduction], I'd suggest moving back and going through these first. This will give you a basis on why this plan is focused on specific training and gradual build up. 

This post will take you through the outline of my training plan, in which I will be strict with pacing and distance, ensuring not to over do it at any point. Please note that I already have a good base for running, therefore it would be advisable to scale up/down the distances for your own needs.

## The Plan
Although you would expect the main focus of the plan to be about running this is not the case. The plan dictates that I will be active 6 days of the week with 1 day of rest.  This may sound like a lot, but it's important to note the intensity of most of these days. Out of all the days, I would say that only 1 of the days is strenuously intensive.  Also, this is highly based around my own situation where I am static most of the day as I have a desk job. Therefore taking the time out my day to exercise is very important for my health both physically and mentally.

| Strength - Lower body | BBH 4km | Strength - Yoga | Intervals	 | Strength - Upper body | Rest     | BBL Run 10Km |
| Strength - Yoga | BBH 4km | Strength - Core | Intervals | Active | Rest | BBL Run 10Km |
| BBH 3Km | Strength - upper Body | Threshold 5Km | Rest | Strength - Yoga | Rest | BBL 11km| 

This shows the first 4 weeks of the plan and from the previous post about [heart rate training][HR Training] you will know the acronyms BBH (base building high) and BBL (base building low), along with the different sessions like intervals and threshold.  
#### Running
I'll be setting out by running 3 times a week, which previously to me would have been a heavy running week, but this is my old understanding of running 100% all the time. This is not the case here, as you can see only one run per week is intensive. This is either a threshold workout or interval work out. These have the purpose of building that anaerobic threshold, building strength and therefore upping my overall pace. 
The other two running sessions are focusing on base building enhancing my muscular and skeletal make up, thus helping my endurance.  The longer of these 2 are steadily building and will do throughout the plan too, but only doing so conservatively. 
#### Active
Around once a week there is a block named active. This is where some type of cross training comes into effect. It's not about having an intensive session again, but just introducing another form of exercise and diversifying.  This help drastically as it ensures that we still have some emphasis on the parts of the body neglected when only running. For myself this will pretty much always be some form of cycling. It'll only be a fairly gentle cycle in and around town, but it will just help get some more miles in the legs, but reducing the impact on my joints etc. 
#### Strength
I feel this is a very important point of this plan. Many runners neglect the strength side of training, believing that getting out for an extra run will benefit them more. This is never true and will more than likely result in injury. This is a particular area that I struggle with. However much rigour and determination I have in my running life, sometimes this just does not translate over to other areas of my life. So I will be focusing on this area a lot and ensuring I put the effort in to minimise that risk of injury.
#### Rest
Obviously this means rest. It does not mean sit all day, but it will certainly mean a reduced work load. A little bit of walking around town etc. But that is the extent of it. 

## Future
As of now, I have actually completed these first 4 weeks of training and I'm really glad to say they have gone very well. I'm injury free, other than a few small niggles, but nothing that will stop me. Between the 2 threshold sessions I managed to shave off 6 seconds/km which is very substantial and generally I'm feeling much better. Day to day, I feel far from the illness I had 5 months ago and hopefully onwards a upwards scale. 

The next 4 weeks are roughly the same as you've seen above only upping the distances. 1 of the weeks I will be running 4 times, which will be interesting to see how my body reacts in terms of any inflammation etc. And at the end of this cycle I should be at 15km for my long run.
