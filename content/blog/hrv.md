## What is Heart Rate Variance
Heart rate variance (HRV) is based on the measurement of time between heart beats. This measure mean is named the R-R interval. Having timings which are more variable gives a higher HRV and vise versa. Most people will know their resting heart rate, or at least understand what heart rate represents. But it may come as a surprise that the timing of the heart rate is not metronomic. There are tiny fluctuations in these R-R intervals, which can be used as a great indicator of fitness and stress on the body and this is what we are going to further explore.

## What does this tell us?
There are many ways to analyse HRV, but in it's most simplistic approach, the higher your HRV the better. But this does not tell the full story. When the body has been stressed and is recovering, for example, the morning after a hard workout, the R-R interval becomes a lot more rhythmic, therefore lowering HRV. This is true of any stressful situation on the body, whether it be recovery from training, illness or even food allergies; essentially anything that can stress your body. So in the inverse to this, when the body is truly rested, the R-R interval becomes much more sporadic and HRV goes up. 

Using this information we can find the optimal time to train without questioning our subjective thoughts. From here we can tune our training plans and also look for trends in the data to further our performance.

## How do we test this?

Measuring HRV is fairly simple, although it takes patience and consistency. One of the biggest issues to understand is that HRV values are personalized, therefore we should not compare scores with one another as everybody's baseline is very different. In addition to this, it is really important to work out a baseline value before amending training routines. 

To perform the measurements, a standard fitness heart rate monitor will be needed. Although smartwatches often have HR functionality, they are not accurate enough to gather this information.  Therefore, a chest mounted monitor is recommended. Next we'll need a mobile application which kicks off the measurement and aggregates the data. I've found [Elite HRV][] to be the easiest and most reliable product for this. Just follow the guidelines in the app and it will take you through the measurements. 

During the first week, the algorithm will be tuning itself to your data, so it's important to stay consistent. To ensure that there are no external effects skewing your measure, it is best to take the measurement in the morning just after you wake up. This ensures the body is in its most rested state and that factors like food, or mental stress have not had an effect on the measurement. Another point to make is the position in which to take the measurement. It's been referenced in this [video][Elite HRV Video] that it is ideal to take the measurement whilst sitting and resting in a chair. Some applications show that it is best to take the measurement whilst lying down, but this has been seen to suppress the response and render it hard to extract the data.

## What I've found

I've been taking my HRV every morning for about 3 months now, and the results are interesting. I've found some great correlation with my training, and sometimes it's obvious to see that I can push further. However, the effect on my joints in response to pushing further in my training will still cause issues.

On the other hand some results have been hard to explain. One anomaly came about when I had super high HRV reading, but the Elite HRV readiness reading was red. This was confusing, because as I explained before, the higher your HRV, the better. However, as we can see, this is not always the case. We know many different things can have an effect on the reading, but in this instance, the effect was unknown. I didn't feel too different; maybe a bad night's sleep but nothing too drastic. I did repeat tests to ensure that it was correct and all 3 tests produced  similar results. So either there was a bug in the software or I really was run down. The lesson to be learnt here is to take HRV as a gentle guide but not a complete solution.
