## Intro
Today I'm going to draw upon my recent experiences and explore the ways we can analyse if our bodies actually need extra rest. When this happened to me, I took a step back from training to analyse how I really felt and have now adjusted my training plan based on these findings, which I will discuss in this post. 

## Are you really depleted?
This is the major question of the article. It is common for our brain to trick us into thinking that we are really tired and are unable to complete the next training session. Often this is not the case and the best thing to do is to go out there and defeat your brain. As I mentioned in my other posts, I do not suffer from this too much and I have a tendency to overtrain. Even when I feel tired, I believe it's still possible to go out there and do my training. But the question remains; Is the fatigue, my brain or my body?

### Heart Rate Variance

If you've not read my last blog about [heart rate variance][HRV] I'd suggest giving it a quick read to see if you could incorporate it in your routine. If you are unsure of what your body signals are trying to tell you, HRV can be a great indicator to help make sense of these signals. HRV will allow you to see a representation of stress on your body. HRV is an optimal measurement, as it is not subjective like your thoughts. However, there are downfalls to HRV measurements. If you are mentally stressed, this can have an adverse effect on the readings and potentially mask the real issues. Using HRV is a great guide to help you understand your bodies physical state, but should not be relied upon as the sole source.

### Injuries
One point to be aware of is the risk of injuries. This is another difficult and very subjective area in which it is possible to find excuses not to train. It's important to know that injury is possible if you overtrain. There are many reasons for this, but one factor is that after your initial training session, your muscles are still in a state of recovery and are not able to work at 100%. This  can cause an imbalance and push stress onto other parts of the body. It is at this point that joints can suffer and muscle failure could occur. How do we know we are going to get injured? This is a subjective analysis, but I often notice how stiff I become after a training session. If I have a smaller range of motion than normal, I am more likely to injure myself. My stride and gait will change slightly to accommodate this decreased motion, which will result in undue stress on the different muscles that are now working.  If you feel confident that your stiffness would dissipate during your run, then I would say it is probably safe for you to train. This is often the case after a long run or workout session, but once the blood starts flowing throw the muscles, they are warmed up and able to perform close to 100%.

### Be subjective and use data

Another good way of analysing why you could be deleted of energy is to look for patterns in data that you have collected. This can be as simple as having a quick look at your training log and finding a correlation. But there are many other aspects to analyse. For example, suffering  from an illness, lack of sleep, mental stress or anything else could affect your will to train. It's really important to throw your emotional thoughts aside during this task and attempt to come to a logical conclusion. I find that tracking as much data as possible allows me to browse through my history and attempt to find patterns which may be causing issues. 

## Real world example
Recently, I encountered a situation in which I used all the method mentioned previously to fully understand what decision to make. The situation started after playing football for the first time in 2 years. Again, I don't like doing things by half, so I ran around like a mad man for an hour and my body really took a beating. The next morning my HRV results were poor?, as can be seen in the image below.

- The data shown in the HRV reading is clearly showing that I have far less energy to expend.
- Three days following the football I was very stiff and my range of motion was drastically reduced. Therefore I was at high risk of injury if I attempted any further exercise.
- And finally, I knew that I had been playing football the day before, so with this data it was understandable why I was feeling depleted of energy. 

As a result of all of this, I missed two training sessions which included an interval session and a long run. I was not too concerned with the intervals as the football substituted for this very well. But I chose to miss the long run as a result of being too stiff. I was confident that my stride and gait would have been affected and would increase my chances of  injury. 

Next time I know to tone it down at football, but also ensure I have a rest day scheduled the day after, along with easy training days the two days after. Overall, this was an enlightening experience and a great way to account for unforseen aspects affecting my training schedule and counteract it.
