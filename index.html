<h2 id="everyone-has-issues:bdfbc040aad2a9be7d416ca4ef522d6f">Everyone has issues</h2>

<p>Everyone in the world has some health issue/s. Some more than others. But just because we think we feel ok, it doesn’t mean we should stop looking for solutions to improve our health. We often answer the question “How are you?” with “Good” , “Ok , “Yeah, not bad”. Only sometimes we respond with feeling “down and out” or react in some negative way. Often this is not the true representation of how we feel, it’s just the amount of personal information we want to divulge. So I’d like to force people to review and ask themselves a question, “How do I feel now?”, which leads us to the question, “How could I feel even better?” This question has no baseline. It just encourages you to seek more from yourself than what you currently have.</p>

<h2 id="the-back-story:bdfbc040aad2a9be7d416ca4ef522d6f">The Back Story</h2>

<p>As this blog title suggests, I had a unusual bout of illness in which the cause was completely unknown to anyone. I also went to numerous doctors in different countries and still received no hard answers. My only forward action was hoping that my body would reset to my known equilibrium and endure the waiting this entailed.</p>

<p>This method did work but only to a certain extent; I improved, but very slowly. Perhaps my issue was more difficult to get rid of or maybe I just wasn’t tackling it in the right way. I don’t want to get into the specifics in this post as I believe everybody’s body is different and can react to the same things in various ways. I, instead, want to focus on what to do going forward.</p>

<h2 id="who-to-listen-to:bdfbc040aad2a9be7d416ca4ef522d6f">Who to listen to?</h2>

<p>The easy answer to this questions is, “Everyone and no one”. In the early stages of my symptoms, my only hope was in doctors.  In  hindsight, this assumption that doctors had all the answers was completely incorrect. . Many errors were made by these doctors (This isn’t to say it was their fault, rather, the healthcare system is not built to help doctors do their job to the best of their abilities).  I even had some scary and highly unnecessary propositions made to me.</p>

<p>If my brain was working at 100% capacity (which, at the time, most definitely wasn’t)  I would have reverted back to my University days and researched as much as possible. A major factor from this experience is that I will confidently err on the side of skepticism  until you’ve researched and understand your own medical situation.</p>

<p>One of my “aha” moments came from a podcast. I’m not saying that that was the solution, but it got me thinking in a different way. Do the research and read in depth into the issues. Work as hard as you can to become a master in the field of “you”. Each individual situation is so unique and specific, it’s completely possible to become a master in knowing yourself and your own body. Nobody knows you better that YOU!</p>

<p>Back to the answer of this question:. We need to listen to everyone (including ourselves) as we can be informed by a variety of sources.</p>

<h2 id="don-t-settle-for-ok:bdfbc040aad2a9be7d416ca4ef522d6f">Don’t settle for OK</h2>

<p>After six months of very gradual improvements I started coming round to the idea that I would never feel 100% again. I’d settled for second best and started looking to other areas of my life which could satisfy me. This is a mental attitude which needs to be squashed! You can always improve, even if it’s only 1%, that is still better.  You never know, by this time next year you may improve by another 1%. If you keep searching for answers you will find new avenues of obtaining them. Personally I found some amazing correlations between my health and information that stemmed from a concept now labelled as  “modern healthcare”. Modern healthcare is looking at your medical, environmental, and biological past and matching them with your current symptoms. They explore the effects of these symptoms through lab testing, subjective feelings, and numerous other tests. I’d never investigated my health history more than I did at this point in time. We discovered  some amazing findings and links to possible historical medical and environmental mistakes. This modern healthcare really took the focus off my “symptom of the day” (which is what all the other doctors focused on) and looked more at the bigger “health picture”. We delveled into underlying problems and attempted to solve these in the assumption that this would push my body into balance.</p>

<h2 id="what-s-the-next-step:bdfbc040aad2a9be7d416ca4ef522d6f">What’s the next step?</h2>

<p>Simple. Keep on searching. While  I feel better a majority of the time  , this doesn’t mean I don’t have “off” days.  My health can further improve and this fact will not change for the rest of my life. My health experience has pushed me further into researching genetics, thus bringing  up some intriguing results that are actionable now, in order to bring about better life for myself going forward.</p>

<p>Unfortunately,  this type of health information is not in mainstream medicine yet. Some would say it is a little experimental, but scientific papers and study groups are the best and only source information we can rely on. Additionally, the data I have found in my genetics has further backed up my lab tests and symptoms I’ve had throughout the last 4 years of my life. To me, this indicates substantial evidence in which to act upon now and in my future.  Again the action here is to keep searching and backup your theories with evidence. Try not to be irrational, do not take anyone and everyone’s opinion and information as gospel. Ensure you backup any information given with your own evidence and verify your own understanding of the situation before you act upon it.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion:bdfbc040aad2a9be7d416ca4ef522d6f">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I set out to write this blog post about the specific information and data I’d found on my health issues. But after the first sentence I decided to write a different blog post. What’s the use in knowing my specific issues, when everyone has slightly different situations? I hope I have encouraged you to research your issues that are relevant to you. Again, you may not even have issues, if not, that is GREAT! Just make sure to research ways in which to improve your life. These improvements can come in various forms including, mental, physical, or emotional. It doesn’t really matter.  Anything you can do to learn more about yourself and your personal health will benefit you in the long run.</p>
